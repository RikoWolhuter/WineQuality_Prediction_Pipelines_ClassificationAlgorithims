Wine Quality - Prediction analysis

Description
The analysis aims to provide a prediction of the quality of wine given the input variables such as:fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates and alcohol. The analysis uses the WineQT Dataset. The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate and improve on the trained model, predict the quality of wine using the trained model, also to train and test different classifiers. 

Installation
Use the package manager pip to install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
1.Open the Jupyter notebook in your local machine.
2.Run the cells in order to get the results.
